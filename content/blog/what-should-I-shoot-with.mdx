I know the struggle, I've been there too buddy, not knowing which camera to use.

There's no secret to be honest, shoot with what you have. Do you have a phone? good, use it. Do you have an old analog camera that you found at your granparents house or at some fancy garage sale, go for it, there's still film being made for most of the cameras out there.

Do you wanna shoot digital? GO FOR FUCKING IT! üôà

Do you want to shoot film? well, now you're screwed. 

*kidding*

Choose whatever you have at hand, don't buy that super expensive camera thinking you will be able to make magic with it.

It might help for sure, but is like shooting an ant with a bazooka. You don't want to do that.

Master the choosen camera/phone, master it's limits. Limit will give you creativity to overcome them. You will master this shit!

**But I love to shoot with my Leica because of this and that**

Does it makes you a better photographer? or you are just a taker?
